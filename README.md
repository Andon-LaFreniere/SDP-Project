## Bow Bros

## What is it?
Bow Bros is a two-player, turn-based game where the goal is to eliminate the opposing player with an arrow before the border fully closes in.

Players begin on opposite corners of a grid and take turns moving toward the center. Each player gets **five moves per turn**, which can be used to traverse one block at a time and/or shoot arrows. After both players complete their turns, the grid borders close in.

As they approach the center, players can choose to take detours to collect power-ups or head straight toward the middle of the map.

## How was it made?
This project was created using **C++** and **The Ohio State University’s Proteus Computer/Microcontroller**. Using the *FEH Proteus Guide | Instructional Guide and Manual*, the team implemented the game’s logic and leveraged the Proteus system’s built-in graphical capabilities.

##What is it?
Bow Bros is a two player turn based game where the goal is to eliminate the other player with an arrow before the border fully closes in.  The players are placed on opposing corners of a grid and take turns traversing towards the center of the grid.  Each player has five moves where they can either traverse a block in the grid and/or shoot arrows before it becomes the other player’s turn.  After both players have had a turn, the grid borders close in.  As players traverse towards the center, they can either decide to take a detour to collect power ups or head directly towards the center of the map.

##How was it made?
With the use of C++ and The Ohio State University’s Proteus Computer/Microcontroller, FEH Proteus Guide | Instructional Guide and Manual, our group was able to program the logic behind the game’s functioning while utilizing the Proteus’s built-in graphical abilities.
